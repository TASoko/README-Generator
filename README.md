# README-Generator
### Description
    This application is a readme generator. Markdown files are a very important part of a web developers life. Every application developed needs a readme to help other codes understand it's purpose. There is an art to markdown files that many people don't know about and this app is to bridge that gap.
## Installation
    Before running this application be sure to run 'npm i' to install all the necessary packages. Without this step nothing will work. 
## Usage
    Once everything is installed type 'node index.js' in the terminal. This will run a series of questions. Answer each question accordingly and once you have a readme will appear in the folder. This straightforward method allows anyone, regardless of their knowledge on markdowns to create a good standard file.
